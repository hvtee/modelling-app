# Electromagnetic Emission Models with Carbon Nanostructured Composites

This project focuses on the software implementation of electromagnetic emission models using carbon nanostructured composite materials. The project is developed in Python, utilizing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The program is organized into logical blocks: Matrix, Fibers, Nanoparticles, Modeling Block, and Display Block. The values for the first three blocks can be created, loaded, saved, and viewed within the program.

## Project Overview

The project leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to provide a structured and modular implementation. The key libraries used include:
- `matplotlib`: Used for visualizing data through plotting.
- `pyplot`: A submodule of `matplotlib` for creating various types of plots.
- `numpy`: Utilized for efficient numerical operations and array manipulation.
- `sqlite3`: Chosen as the database for data storage.

## Logical Blocks

### 1. Matrix
This block is responsible for managing the properties of the matrix used in the composite material.

### 2. Fibers
The Fibers block deals with the characteristics of the fibers embedded in the composite.

### 3. Nanoparticles
Nanoparticles block handles the properties and behavior of nanoparticles integrated into the composite structure.

### 4. Modeling Block
The Modeling Block encompasses the algorithms and calculations for simulating electromagnetic emission based on the composition and properties of the materials.

### 5. Display Block
The Display Block is responsible for visualizing the results of the modeling process using `matplotlib` and `pyplot`.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/electromagnetic-models.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:
cd electromagnetic-models

4. Install the required libraries if not already installed:
pip install matplotlib numpy

5. Open the `main.py` file in your preferred text editor.

6. Replace `controller` with the actual module name or path.

7. Save the file.

8. In your terminal, execute the following command to run the program:
python main.py

9. The program will start, and you'll be able to interact with the different blocks and functionalities using the command-line interface.
